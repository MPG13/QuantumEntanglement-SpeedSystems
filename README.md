__*To avoid getting caught:*__
- do not save the files on a Lightspeed computer
- run the files from an external drive (flash drive, SD, etc)
- perform this on a computer where it can only be traced to your login. To elaborate, don't run it in a computer class, run it from the library or open-to-student computer lab, where cameras cannot see you. This way they have no record that you were at the computer at the time of the cammands being run.
- avoid running this from your own student login, if possible. Not vital, but an extra pecaution. (terminal logs are stored on the machine, and are not linked to student logins)

The bend is what allows us to warp limitation, while still maintaining its origin. <sup>A windows computer with lightspeed restrictions software installed is required to use this file.</sup>

The passage is what we use to travel through restriction. <sup>The bat file lets us harness the command line, and access a higher authority.</sup>

The base is to thank for existence. <sup>Lightspeed Wifi is the base level - as in without it, we wouldn't have a restricted wifi to exploit..</sup>

The mouth of the entanglement opens up possibilities, formerly thought to be absurd. <sup>QuantumEntanglement.bat lets is just the beginning of the ride.</sup>
