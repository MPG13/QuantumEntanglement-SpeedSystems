__*To avoid getting caught:*__
- do not save the files on a Lightspeed computer
- run the files from an external drive (flash drive, SD, etc)
- perform this on a computer where it can only be traced to your login. To elaborate, don't run it in a computer class, run it from the library or open-to-student computer lab, where cameras cannot see you. This way they have no record that you were at the computer at the time of the cammands being run.
- avoid running this from your own student login, if possible. Not vital, but an extra pecaution. (terminal logs are stored on the machine, and are not linked to student logins)
