To avoid getting caught:

do not save the files on a Lightspeed computer
run the files from an external drive (flash drive, SD, etc)
perform this on a computer where it can only be traced to your login. To elaborate, don't run it in a computer class, run it from the library or open-to-student computer lab, where cameras cannot see you. This way they have no record that you were at the computer at the time of the cammands being run.
avoid running this from your own student login, if possible. Not vital, but an extra pecaution. (terminal logs are stored on the machine, and are not linked to student logins)
